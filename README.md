This folder mimics "/kaggle"  in kaggle' s kernel.   
(The repo's name was `s_kaggle`, and `s` in `s_kaggle` means "slash" ) 

# Usage

```bash
# 1. May need to modify some dataset related paths in pre_proc.py and run_train.zsh first 
# 2. Modify some alias in run_train.zsh, (see comments there)
cd working  &&  python pre_proc.py && bash run_train.zsh
```
